<p>Provides functionality to create and modify database schema / metadata so that it can be evolved over time
in a recreatable and deterministic way. This is done by versioning the database schema.
This API gives you database independence for your schema definition since all the SQL is generated by the DbAdapter.</p>

<p>There is also the ability to include raw SQL statements from a file. These files can be defined for each database 
type in order to preserve database independence.</p>

<p>Getting Started:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Run org.apache.cayenne.migration.MigrationGenerator to generate the initial Migration from your Cayenne project file (model). 
	This class has a main method that takes two arguments: 
	1) the name or path to your cayenne project file (domain) and 
	2) the output directory. 
	It will create a java class with all the calls necessary to create your tables and foreign key constraints, etc. 
	This java class needs to be moved into your project after being generated.</li>
	<li>At application startup time create a org.apache.cayenne.migration.Migrator object and call migrateToLatest(). For example:</li>
</ul>
<pre>
try {
    new Migrator(domain.getDataNode("production"), MyDataMap0.class.getPackage().getName()).migrateToLatest();
} catch (SQLException e) {
    throw new RuntimeException("Unable to migrate database to current version: " + e.getMessage(), e);
}
</pre>
